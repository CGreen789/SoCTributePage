# ⛰️ The Peak District ⛰️

I created this repo before I started my School of Code course. We had to complete parts of the @freeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design course before we could start the course.


I really enjoyed writing my own HTML and styling with CSS. This is a very basic webpage, but I made it very early on in my coding journey and I'm proud of how far I've come in the time!
